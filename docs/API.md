# ArtDera API

All endpoints return either `{ "success": true, "data": ..., "message": ... }` or `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "fieldErrors": {} } }`. JSON writes reject unknown fields. IDs, query limits, dates, prices, slugs, and status transitions are validated server-side.

Authentication uses the `artdera_session` HTTP-only cookie. “Owner” means the authenticated object owner; gallery-staff operations additionally require the assigned permission.
